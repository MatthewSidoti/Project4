This app is used to track inventory and add recipes. I added a dashboard that shows how much inventory and when stock is getting low.

I started creating this app as a way to share drink recipes and to check the inventory to see if those items are available to make said recipes.
This is the start of that idea. I have so much more i want to add after this "project" is over.
